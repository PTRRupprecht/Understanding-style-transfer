# Understanding style transfer

This is a Jupyter notebook which accompanies a [blog post](https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2017/12/05/understanding-style-transfer/). Together with the blog post, it should be more or less self-explanatory, since it consists mainly of plots.

Using a pre-trained GoogLeNet and deep dreams to analyze Gram matrices. A large fraction of the code, especially the part related to deep dreams, is based on a [tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream) by Alexander Mordvintsev.

If you have questions, please let me know.
